      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sprint-vs-the-marathon&#34;&gt;The Sprint vs. The Marathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our industry, it is easy to get caught up in the immediate: the &amp;ldquo;IPO hunt,&amp;rdquo; the constant job-hopping for a salary bump, or the rush to ship the next feature. We optimize for the next two years, often at the expense of the next twenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reflecting on Will Larson’s concept of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Forty-Year Career.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; His argument is a necessary counter-narrative: instead of burning out for short-term wins, we should focus on compounding gains over decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-transfer-of-fundamentals&#34;&gt;The Transfer of Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent article, Mallika Rao (Engineering Manager at Netflix) revisits a familiar friction point in our industry: the transition from maker to manager. She argues that when engineers move into leadership roles, they often stop applying the systems thinking they developed through years of hands-on engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a massive missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend years learning how to optimize throughput, manage load, and debug complex interactions. Yet, when we step into management, we often treat the team as something entirely different, governed by vague intuition rather than structural logic. Rao suggests that systems thinking isn&amp;rsquo;t just for code—it is an essential toolkit for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-reality-of-urgency-in-startups&#34;&gt;The Reality of Urgency in Startups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s crucial for every senior software engineer, technical leader, or anyone accountable for delivering technical solutions to know how to handle urgent tasks wisely. Let’s call this person a &lt;em&gt;leader&lt;/em&gt; — and today, that’s you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some industries, or at certain stages of a company’s lifecycle, urgent requirements hit technical teams constantly. I currently work as a technical lead at a startup (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/company/donetech/&#34;&gt;Done&lt;/a&gt;), where the rules of the game seem to change every other week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
