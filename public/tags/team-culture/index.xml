      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-transfer-of-fundamentals&#34;&gt;The Transfer of Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent article, Mallika Rao (Engineering Manager at Netflix) revisits a familiar friction point in our industry: the transition from maker to manager. She argues that when engineers move into leadership roles, they often stop applying the systems thinking they developed through years of hands-on engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a massive missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spend years learning how to optimize throughput, manage load, and debug complex interactions. Yet, when we step into management, we often treat the team as something entirely different, governed by vague intuition rather than structural logic. Rao suggests that systems thinking isn&amp;rsquo;t just for code—it is an essential toolkit for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
